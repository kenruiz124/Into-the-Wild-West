		<h1>Duel with Randall</h1>
		<p>The rules of any duel are that you must draw your gun as soon as the clock hits high noon, but can someone as shady as Rotten Randall really be trusted? What will you do?</p>
		<p><a href="rottenWin.html">Shoot early.</a></p>
		<p><a href="rottenLose.html">Shoot at high noon.</a></p>
