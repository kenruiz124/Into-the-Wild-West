		<h1>Rotten Randall</h1>
		<p>As you enter the bar, you’re suddenly approached by the repulsive scoundrel, Rotten Randall. Looking to add some merit to his name, he challenges you to a “completely fair and honest” duel in the field outside. Being an essential rule of the Wild West, you have to accept or face being shunned.</p>
		<p><a href="rottenDuel.html">Accept the challenge.</a></p>
